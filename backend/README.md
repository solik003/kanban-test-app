## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the backend:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd your-project/backend

2. Install dependencies:
    npm install
3. Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory and add your environment variables:
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
    JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
4. Start the backend application:
    npm start

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or Insomnia. Make sure to send requests to http://localhost:3000.

For example, to create a new board, send a POST request to:
    POST /api/boards
with a JSON body like:
    {
    "name": "New Board",
    "description": "A description for the new board."
    }
